# STL-CPP
 learning how to use standard template library in cpp

 27/1/25: after solving questions on leetcode using c, ive finally decided to start using cpp as it will save me a lot of time and i wont have to write a massive code for implementing concepts such as hashing which is taking a lot of time. i know how hashing fuctions work so i think its finally time to start using STL to help me save time and do more questions.
